Survival analysis for multi-modal data using deep learning, and a streamlit web app for user interaction

Use an encoder-decoder architecture to compress and consume multi-modal inputs to extract features from the encoder kernel.

Use survival analysis using gradient boosted trees with scikit-survival library, with features from encoder as well as clinical, genetic features.

Streamlit is used to build a web-app for interaction, training visualization and prediction (inference).
